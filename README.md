# Siglyx website

Adapted from
[bulma-clean-theme](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme)
which is based on the [Bulma](https://bulma.io) framework, providing
a modern-looking site to start with. The theme uses
[Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) for its interactive
components, such as mobile navbar and notifications.


## Install and Compile

``
$ bundle config set --local path /home/user/src/vendor
$ bundle install
``

To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your
browser at `http://localhost:4000`.
As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site
will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a
refresh, just like normal.
